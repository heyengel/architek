# Architek
Architek is a predictive analytics prototype for buildings.  Using machine learning, historical user and weather data, the prediction model provides advance information to the building management system (BMS), allowing the building to better manage resources and anticipate occupant load demands, which reduces energy consumption, reduce operating costs and provides healthier indoor environments.
