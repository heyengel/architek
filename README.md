# Architek
Architek is a predictive analytics prototype for buildings.  Using machine learning, historical user and weather data, the prediction model provides advance information to the building management system (BMS), allowing the building to better manage resources and anticipate occupant load demands, which reduces energy consumption, reduce operating costs and provides healthier indoor environments.

## Motivation
Buildings consume nearly half of all the energy produced and responsible for nearly half of carbon emissions in the United States, significantly more than all the vehicles on the road.  The mechanical and electrical systems of a building approaches 70% of a buildings energy usage.  Currently, these systems are reactive, instead of predictive.

## Goals / Solution
Reduce building energy consumption, reduce operating costs and provide healthier indoor environments with increased use of natural ventilation. Understand time series correlations between weather and building occupancy data to predict future short term demand.  I believe that significant cost and energy can be saved if the building automation system is able to anticipate demand.
